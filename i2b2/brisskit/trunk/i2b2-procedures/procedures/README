PREREQUISITES.
==============
If you have i2b2 installed, then the prerequisites are almost certainly present.
Other run-time dependencies are held within the lib directory.

QUICK START.
============
1. Unzip this package into a convenient place on a server hosting an i2b2 domain.
2. Set the I2B2_PROCEDURES_HOME environment variable and export it.
3. Ensure the following environment variables are set within your config file
     JAVA_HOME 
     ANT_HOME 
     JBOSS_HOME
4. Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   Basically three files:
   config.properties
   defaults.sh
   log4j.properties
   
DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Inspect the POM.
===========================================
There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions)... 

To build a production artifact, the default install invocation is sufficient...
mvn install

To build a development artifact...
mvn install -Denvironment.type=development

The development version has facilities for dropping all sql artifacts. 
Hence you must explicitly request a development build.
